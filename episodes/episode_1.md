## Episode 1: "Coming out half-baked"
Â£170 Budget - preferably under for client satisfaction
1st September 2020
Birthday party
"too old"
17 people at the party
EVERYTHING MUST BE CONSUMED
+ sausage rolls
+ triangle egg sandwiches
+ plenty of drink

+ drunk eating therefore greater potential of cake consumption

+ previous success cases

+ potential for melting - no refrigeration

+ ~~royal icing is a potential solution~~

How might we produce a gluten-free, yet, palatable cake for a medium-sized birthday party in the sun, where we're unsure of how many people will eat the cake.

```
HMW transport the cake safely given the transport and competency risks we have over the proposed cycling solution.
```

### Cake Requirements
"as the cake, I must be transported safely without breakage on the back of a bicycle." 
 "as a cake eater, I would like a cake that I can eat with my hands"

 "as a cake eater, I would like the option to have 3 pieces of cake"

 "as a cake, I need to be fully assembled"

### Party thrower
"as a transporter of the cake, I am a wobbly and ineffective cyclist."

 "as a party thrower, i dont want a lot of left over cake"

### Party Attendee
 "as an attendee of the party, i want a piece of cake"
 -- easily sliceable
 
 "as an attendee of the party, I am indifferent to the physical manifestation of the cake I eat."

 "I do not have a mouth, I will need to consume cake intravenously"



- serverless? self-serve?

+ ~~cupcakes~~
+ ~~upside down cake~~

- is it an n-layer cake
